    '%cI’m Zoey, and I’ve got a secret to tell you. You might think I’m just your average black, round-bellied dog who’s a little too fond of naps and snacks, but oh, there’s more to me than that. Thirteen years old, but who’s counting? Age is just a number when you’re living the dream. \n\n' +
    'I wasn’t always this... *generous* in size. I blame the bacon. You see, it all started with those crispy, mouthwatering strips my humans would “accidentally” drop on the floor. It didn’t take long before I realized they weren’t accidents. That’s when I knew—I had them wrapped around my little paw.\n\n' +
    'Napping, though, that’s my true calling. I’ve perfected the art. Sunbeams on the floor? That’s my spa. The couch? That’s my throne. Every soft surface in the house has seen me draped across it, snoring softly, belly rising and falling like the tides. But my favorite is the bed. Oh, the bed. If you think I’m not supposed to be up there... well, good luck convincing me otherwise.\n\n' +
    'But food? Ah, food is the highlight of my existence. It’s not just sustenance, it’s a *celebration*. When I hear that kibble clatter into the bowl, or, better yet, smell the waft of chicken from the kitchen, I transform. I go from being a sleepy ball of fur to the most energetic, tail-wagging, food-dancing dog you’ve ever seen. I might be slow on my walks, but I’m fast when there’s a crumb involved.\n\n' +
    'Sure, my age is catching up to me. Thirteen years of good food, great naps, and more love than my heart could ever hold. I’ve earned every gray whisker, every extra pound. But don’t let my slow shuffle fool you—inside, I’m still that joyful puppy who lives for belly rubs and treats. Every day I wake up, stretch my chubby paws, and decide that today, like every day, will be another good one filled with joy, naps, and, if I’m lucky, a little extra bacon.',
