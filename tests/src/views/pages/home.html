    <h2>Howdy, Welcome to My World!</h2>
    <p>
        Hi there! I’m Zoey, a 13-year-old pup with a heart full of love and a belly always ready for a snack. My days are filled with the joys of walking (not running, please), sleeping in cozy spots, and cuddling with my favorite humans. I’ve learned a lot in my golden years—like how to do some pretty cool tricks and how to always find the best snacks!
    </p>
    <p>
        But don't let my age fool you; I still love to play, chase squirrels, and discover the wonders of nature, even if I do it all at my own pace. Just don’t try to trick me or make me run—those are definitely not my favorite things!
    </p>

        This is my little corner of the internet, where you can learn more about me, see some of my favorite moments in my gallery, and maybe even get in touch. Thanks for stopping by—now, where’s that snack?
    </p>
